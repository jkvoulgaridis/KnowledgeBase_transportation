# KnowledgeBase_transportation
A project for the course of Knowledge Systems @ECE.NTUA, GR.


 This project implements a knowledge base for the means of public transportation in Athens, Greece.  There are 3 distinct parts: 
 
 ## 1. Create the ontology using Protege siftware. 
 
 In this part every class, object which is needed for describing the means of transportations is defined. We also define relationships among classes, objects. 
 
 ## 2. Cast data from raw ttl to rdf triplets. 
 
 ## 3. Query over the Knowledge base using sparql. 


## Important Notices  

1. Some input files are not in this directory because of their large size. 
2. the main file (describing the ontology) is turtle.ttl
